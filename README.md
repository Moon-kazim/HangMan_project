# HangMan_project

here we are going to complete this project in 5 steps!

# step 1
#TODO-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word. Then print it.
#TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.
#TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word. Print "Right" if it is, "Wrong" if it's not.

# step 2
#TODO-1: Create a "placeholder" with the same number of blanks as the chosen_word
#TODO-2: Create a "display" that puts the guess letter in the right positions and _ in the rest of the string.

# step 3
#TODO-1: - Use a while loop to let the user guess again.
#TODO-2: Change the for loop so that you keep the previous correct letters in display.
