# HangMan_project

here we are going to complete this project in 5 steps!

# step 1
#TODO-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word. Then print it.
#TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.
#TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word. Print "Right" if it is, "Wrong" if it's not.

# step 2
#TODO-1: Create a "placeholder" with the same number of blanks as the chosen_word
#TODO-2: Create a "display" that puts the guess letter in the right positions and _ in the rest of the string.

# step 3
#TODO-1: - Use a while loop to let the user guess again.
#TODO-2: Change the for loop so that you keep the previous correct letters in display.

# step 4
#TODO-1: - Create a variable called 'lives' to keep track of the number of lives left.
#TODO-2: - If guess is not a letter in the chosen_word, Then reduce 'lives' by 1.

# step 5
#TODO-1: - Update the word list to use the 'word_list' from hangman_words.py
#TODO-3: - Import the logo from hangman_art.py and print it at the start of the game.
#TODO-6: - Update the code below to tell the user how many lives they have left.
#TODO-4: - If the user has entered a letter they've already guessed, print the letter and let them know.
#TODO-5: - If the letter is not in the chosen_word, print out the letter and let them know it's not in the word.
    #TODO 7: - Update the print statement below to give the user the correct word they were trying to guess.
#TODO-2: - Update the code below to use the stages List from the file hangman_art.py
